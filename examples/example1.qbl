# Usage:

# Dialog mode:
# qbl> import examples/example1.qbl
# qbl> run circ1
# qbl> run circ1 + circ4
# qbl> list                             # list of all objects in memory
# qbl> info <object_name>               # info about object

# Bash:
# $ qubitlab run circ1 examples/example1.qbl
# $ qubitlab run circA + circB file1.qbl file2.qbl
# $ qubitlab list file.qbl                              # list of all objects in memory
# $ qubitlab info <object_name> file.qbl                # info about object
